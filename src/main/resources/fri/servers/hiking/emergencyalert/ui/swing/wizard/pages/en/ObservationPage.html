            The <b>time observation</b> of your hike is now running.
            The application will output control messages
            in the green (progress) and red (errors) text areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is possible that you immediately get an error,
            for example when the mail/internet connection got lost meanwhile,
            so better have a look before you set off.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Do not shut down your computer, do not set it to sleep, do not turn off the modem!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The window can not be closed now, you need to press the "Home Again" button. 
            A dialog will ask if you really want to terminate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Afterwards you can either start a new hike, when you were back in time,
            or have a look at the passed one. The window can be closed then again.
