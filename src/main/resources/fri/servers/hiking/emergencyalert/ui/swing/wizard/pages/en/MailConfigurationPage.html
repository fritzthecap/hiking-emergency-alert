            <b>E-mail configuration</b> is not an easy task. 
            You can find your mail settings on Android phones in 
            <i>Settings -> Apps -> E-Mail ->
            E-Mail settings ->
            tap on the account (E-Mail Address) ->
            scroll all the way down to Server Settings ->
            Incoming Server, Outgoing Server.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter your mail user name, this is most likely your e-mail address. 
            Then enter the host names for receiving and sending.
            The "pop3" an "imap" protocols are for receiving mails,
            the "smtp" protocol is for sending, we need both.
            Push the "Test Connection" button to enter your password
            and try a connection. When you get strange error messages,
            you most likely need secure mail settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many mail providers do not allow insecure connections 
            on "pop3" port 110, "imap" port 143 and "smtp" port 25 anymore. 
            You need to activate custom properties to achieve that.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, switch to "imaps" or "pop3s" (s for secure), but do not yet switch to "smtps". 
            The receive-port gets adjusted when you toggle the protocol.
            Port 993 should now be visible for "imaps", or 995 for "pop3s". 
            In the "smtp" port field, write 465 (alternatives would be 587 or 2525). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now use the "More Properties" button to add custom properties, 
            these reside in the lower part of the dialog that opens.
            First activate the 
        </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>mail.smtp.socketFactory.class = javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory</i></p>
        <p>
            property and save. Again try the "Test Connection" button. 
            If this doesn't work, try some of the <i>"mail.xxx.ssl.enable"</i> properties. 
            All the listed properties have non-default values, 
            so that simply activating them would show if they make the connection work. 
            You could also ask the Internet for help on <i>jakarta mail</i> properties.

            When navigating forward from here, the application tries to connect
            to your INBOX, then sends a mail to your own account, receives it and also deletes it. 
            No junk-mails will remain in your INBOX from this test, 
            and it should be finished in seconds.
            If your internet connection is slow, you may want to set the
            "Maximum Connection Wait" seconds to a higher value.
