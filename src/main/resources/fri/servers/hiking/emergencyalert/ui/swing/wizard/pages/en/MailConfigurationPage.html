            <b>E-mail configuration</b> is not an easy task, but you need it. 
            You can find your configuration for example on Android phones in 
            <i>Settings -> Apps -> E-Mail ->
            E-Mail settings ->
            tap on the account (E-Mail Address) ->
            scroll all the way down to Server Settings ->
            Incoming Server, Outgoing Server.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            You may want to use other ports than secure ones, 
            because the application has not been tested with secure mail. 
            Anyway you can use the "More Properties" button 
            to add connection settings (search for <i>jakarta email</i> documentations).
        </p>
        <p>
            Both IMAP and POP3 protocols should work for receiving. 
            Mind that their port is adjusted automatically when you toggle the protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
            When navigating forward from here, the application tries to connect
            to your INBOX, then sends a mail to it, receives it and also deletes it. 
            Your password will be requested through a dialog.
            No junk-mails will remain in your INBOX from this test, 
            and it should be finished in seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your internet connection is slow, you should set the
            "Maximum Connection Wait" seconds to a higher value.
