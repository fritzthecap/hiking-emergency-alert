        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
            This desktop application runs at home while you are out on a hike.
            It starts sending <b>alert e-mails</b> if you are not back within the scheduled time. 
            <b>In case you have an accident in an area with no phone connection, this might save your life!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You need to have a <b>mail-provider</b> and -account, and a computer with <b>Internet connection</b>.
            Further you need <b>mail contacts</b>, at least one, 
            that could organize help for you in case of an emergency.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>None of your contacts will receive an e-mail when you are back in time
                and press the <i style="white-space: nowrap;">"Home Again"</i> button.</li><br/>
                
            <li>But when you are overdue, the first contact will get an e-mail 
                (with a text you are going to work out now).</li><br/>
                
            <li>If a contact does not respond within an hour, the next contact will get the same e-mail,
                and the previous will be notified about that shift.
                Of course all of this is configurable.</li><br/>
                
            <li>When one of the contacts responds to the alert e-mail, no more contacts will be notified.</li><br/>
            
            <li>The application uses a unique MAIL-ID to distinguish alert responses from your private e-mails.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            On this first page you can choose your language,
            or load a hike-file in case you already created hikes before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next time you start this application, you most likely will not see this page any more, 
            but you can always navigate <i>"Back"</i> to it and load old hikes.
            They get stored in JSON format by default in 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 8"><code>$HOME/hiking-emergency-alert/hike.json</code></p>
        <p>
            You can change that default by running the application with 
            <code>-Dhike.home=MyDirectory</code>
            and <code>-Dhike.file=MyFile.json</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also change the font-size between 80 and 140 percent, using  
            <code>-Dhike.fontPercent=120</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>This is an open-source application that does not leak or steal your data,
            although it needs Internet connection to send alert e-mails and receive response e-mails.
            Your e-mail provider password will not be stored anywhere, 
            you have to input it manually on every hike start.
