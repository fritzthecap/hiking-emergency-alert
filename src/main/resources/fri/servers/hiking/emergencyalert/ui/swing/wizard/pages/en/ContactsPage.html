            Before your hike you do <b>six steps</b> here, the "Contacts" page is the second.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have to enter at least your <b>name</b> and one <b>e-mail contact</b>. 
            Watch the red validation message on top. 
            Clicking anywhere outside an input-field should make it disappear when the input was fixed.
            Otherwise, as long as such an error is displayed, you won't be able to navigate forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may want to use address and phone number as variables in the 
            text of the e-mail you are going to work out in the next step, 
            so it may be useful to also enter it.
            All these data will be stored and you won't have to do them again.
        </p>
        <p>
            On bottom there are time-interval settings.
            After sending an alert e-mail at your planned home-time, the application waits
            the <i>"Alert Send Interval"</i> minutes until it sends another e-mail to the next contact. 
            You can make this wait-time shorter with each contact by using the <i>"Shrinking Percent"</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively you can assign an estimated e-mail detection time to each contact
            and use this as wait-times. When you didn't enter such a time for a contact,
            60 minutes will be taken as default.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application detects response e-mails that contain the MAIL-ID of the sent alert. 
            With a <i>"Confirmation Receive Interval"</i> of 2 minutes, the application
            would try to receive response every 2 minutes.
            When it receives one, it stops the observation, assuming that help is on the way.
