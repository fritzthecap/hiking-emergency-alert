            All inputs have been saved to disk when you arrive on the "Times and Route" page, 
            next time you won't have to do your mail-configuration again (except password input).
            Now you start to describe your hike. 
            This will be saved just optionally if you agree to a save-dialog.

            The end time is essential.
