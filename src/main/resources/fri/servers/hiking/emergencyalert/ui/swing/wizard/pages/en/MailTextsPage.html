            Create the <b>texts of your "Alert E-Mail"</b> carefully.
            The "E-Mail Subject" should indicate the urgency of the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The content text will consist of three parts.
            Below the automatically created salutation on top,
            the "Alert E-Mail Text" gives the introductory sentences.
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid excited confusion, you then should tell the contact person what to do, step by step.
            Use the "+" and "-" buttons to add and remove steps, edit their texts in the field below.
            The steps will be numbered automatically by the application,
            you will see the full text on the final "Activation" page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third and last part is the hike route description. 
            However, this is not done here but on a coming page,
            because it will be different for every hike.
        </p>
        <p>
            Optionally there will be a "Continue-to-next" E-mail.
            This is sent to any contact that did not respond in time,
            and should tell that another person has been alerted. 
            It is useful to avoid a whole chain of people trying to organize help.
