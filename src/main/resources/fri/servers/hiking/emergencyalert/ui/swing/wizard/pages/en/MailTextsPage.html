        <p>
            Create the <b>texts of your "Alert E-Mail"</b> carefully.
            The "E-Mail Subject" should indicate the urgency of the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mail text will consist of three parts.
            Below the automatically created salutation on top,
            the "Alert E-Mail Text" gives the introduction.
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid excited confusion, you then should tell the contact person what to do, step by step.
            Use the "+" and "-" buttons to add and remove steps, edit their texts in the field below.
            The steps will be numbered automatically by the aplication,
            you will see that on the final "Activation" page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third and last part is the hike route description, 
            which is to be entered on a coming page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Optionally there will be the so-called "Continue-to-next" E-mail.
            This is sent to any contact (except the last) that did not respond in time,
            and should tell that another person has been alerted. 
            It is useful to avoid a whole chain of people trying to organize help. 
        </p>
