StateMachineGreenmailTest fails:
    1) new send connectionCheck has UnknownHostException: smtp.provider.country
    2) third sent mail is not a passing-to-next- but an alert-mail

Custom mail properties must be stored to JSON and merged
    when authenticating.

The mail text needs $macros for plannedBeginTime, endTime
    and name of "to"-contact person, maybe MAIL-ID.
    
Implement Swing UserInterface and use it in AlertHomeServer.

Implement read, edit and write JSON files about Hikes.

Write more unit tests with greenmail like StateMachineTest2.
