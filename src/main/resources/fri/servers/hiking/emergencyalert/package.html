            A solution for safety against hiking accidents 
            in places where no cell-phone communication is possible.
            Users need a mail account and at least one contact person
            that would receive an emergecy alert in case of an accident. 
            The hiker's home-computer must be up-and-running with internet access
            during the hike. It would start to send alerts when the hiker
            did not return until a planned home-time.
