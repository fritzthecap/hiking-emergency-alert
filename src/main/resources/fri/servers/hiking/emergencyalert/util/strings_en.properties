# Empty workaround resource-bundle for ENGLISH, falling back to strings.properties.
#
# This file MUST EXIST to make loading of Locale.ENGLISH resources 
# possible in case system-property "user.language" is, for example, "de",
# because then it would fall back to strings_de.properties and
# you would get GERMAN texts for setup language ENGLISH !
#
# Got this workaround from https://hwellmann.blogspot.com/2010/02/misconceptions-about-java.html
