# Empty resource-bundle that falls back to strings.properties.
#
# This file MUST EXIST to make loading of Locale.ENGLISH resources 
# possible in case system-property "user.language" is for example "de",
# because then it would fall back to strings_de.properties and
# you would get GERMAN texts for ENGLISH !!!
