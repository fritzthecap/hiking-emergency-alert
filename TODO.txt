When canceling the hike and going back, then 
    going forward again to start again, this error happens:
    "Timer can be started just once!"
    StateMachine must be put back into HikeRegisteredState!

Required input fields must be marked somehow.

Passing-to-next mail text should be optional, not mandatory.
    Add a checkbox on UI.

It should be possible to press "Home Again" even
    in state "Activated" when planned begin time has not yet arrived.
    Currently this would give an error.
    Follower state must be HomeAgain then.

Implement JSON Hike file loading and saving.

Left side descriptions of current wizard page, in HTML

Right side output and error consoles for System out/err streams.

The whole application needs bigger fonts!

Multi-language support for at least German.

Write more unit tests with greenmail like StateMachineTest2.
